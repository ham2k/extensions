// What the IARU Region 1 VHF+ contest family and RSGB's own share: the
// REG1TEST/EDI writer both submit, the grid half of an exchange both send,
// the ref readers both store it with, and the band multiplier both score by.
//
// Here rather than in either extension because a published extension may not
// reach into another one's source, and two copies of a scoring table diverge.
// `reg1test.ts` is a format writer with no contest in it, deliberately the
// shape `@ham2k/lib-qson-cabrillo`'s writer has: if the host ever carries it,
// only the manifests change.
