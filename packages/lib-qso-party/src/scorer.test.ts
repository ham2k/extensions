// QSO-party scoring. Two kinds of test here, and the second kind is the point:
//
//   * the ordinary business — points by mode, multipliers, duplicates;
//   * the rules that only ONE party has, which is where an engine silently
//     loses things. Every option a shipped party sets is exercised against the
//     party that sets it, so a change that stops reading one fails here rather
//     than quietly scoring nothing.
//
// The rover cases are the subject this engine exists for: our county comes from
// the ref handed to `scoreQso`, which the host resolves per segment, so "we
// moved" is modelled by scoring later QSOs against a different ref.
