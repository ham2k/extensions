// The party as the rest of the engine reads it: the author's params with every
// documented default filled in, and every hand-typed code spelled the one way
// everything else spells it.
//
// Two normalizations survive the move from data to code, because both sides of
// the comparison are still typed by hand off a sponsor's PDF:
//
//   * county codes and bonus callsigns are UPPERCASED, since a logged callsign
//     and a typed exchange both arrive uppercase;
//   * `Ø` — the slashed zero hams write — becomes the digit it stands for, so a
//     bonus station written `WØMA` matches the `W0MA` in the log. Without it
//     Missouri's two 100-point bonuses could not be claimed at all.
//
// The normalizations the params types make impossible are gone: the three
// spellings of the power table, `DIGI` beside `DATA` in one points map, an
// exchange declared as an array of field names, and the two option names for
// the one "counties are multipliers in the party" rule.
