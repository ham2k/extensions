// A party extension is a manifest and one of these. Nothing here is a lookup
// into a bundled table of 49 parties — each extension carries its own — so the
// two identity fields the app-wide version derives from a party KEY are stated
// outright instead:
//
//   * `refType` is the ref's own `type` (`{type: 'txqp'}` — the sponsor's own
//     Cabrillo contest name, lower-cased), where the bundled version carried
//     `{type: 'qp', ref: 'TX'}`. A ref with no `ref` field cannot name a party
//     by key.
//   * `state` is the state or province a county belongs to when nothing else
//     says — the answer the bundled version took from the party key, which no
//     longer exists. A single-state party needs it, because its own county
//     codes carry no state; a party spanning several must NOT have one, because
//     no one of its states outranks the others.
//
// Every option is optional and every default is stated on the field. A party
// file states the rules its sponsor publishes and nothing else.
