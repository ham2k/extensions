// How a party is found, set up and typed into.
//
// One extension is ONE party, so nothing here asks which one: the party the
// operator chose is the extension they enabled, and what the setup form asks for
// is where they are operating from and what they are claiming.
//
// **What a rover does, and why nothing here implements it.** A county changes
// mid-log through SEGMENTS: the operator types BREAK and edits the location in
// setup, `refs` is one of the keys a segment restates, and the scorer is handed
// the segment-effective ref for every QSO. "Rolling location scoring" is a
// property of where the county is READ from, not a mechanism this module owns.
