// an operation is in and to reach the feeds that carry it, and nothing of the
// rules or the county tables. An extension that reads every party at once
// (the QSO-party spots source, the APRS beacon) imports `identities.ts`, which
// holds one of these per party and weighs a few kilobytes, where the full
// `PARTIES` map would carry every county list into its bundle.
//
// The two readers below are the only code in this package: which party an
// operation is in, and which counties its ref names. Both spotting
// extensions ask them, and two copies of the legacy-prefix rule would be two
// answers to which party a `qp` ref belongs to.
