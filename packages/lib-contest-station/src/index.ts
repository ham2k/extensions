// Who a contest entry names, the same in every contest.
//
//   * The OPERATORS are whoever the log says logged: each contact carries its
//     operator's call, or none when the station's own holder made it. So they
//     are found, never typed — a typed list goes stale the moment someone
//     else sits down, and the log already knows.
//   * The STATION OWNER is the operation's `ownerCall` (extension API 21),
//     set in the app's Operation Details: whose station this is when it
//     belongs to none of the operators. Cabrillo names it as `@CALL` at the
//     end of OPERATORS; the app's own ADIF export writes OWNER_CALLSIGN.
//   * The CLUB is seeded from the operator's profile, so the field shows what
//     will be sent rather than a placeholder promising it.
