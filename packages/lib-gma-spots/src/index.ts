// cqgma.org's spot endpoint, which several unrelated award programs post
// through: GMA itself plus the castle, lighthouse, mill and tower awards that
// use its infrastructure — `ham2k-bca`, `ham2k-blha`, `ham2k-eca`,
// `ham2k-ela`, `ham2k-gma`, `ham2k-mota`, `ham2k-tota`, `ham2k-wca`.
//
// A package rather than a file each of them copies: eight copies of one
// endpoint's quirks diverge, and the quirks below are the whole content. Each
// extension bundles it, so it declares `@ham2k/lib-callsigns` in its own
// manifest's `sharedDependencies` — the build rewrites the import there, not
// here.
//
// The endpoint is a form POST that answers 200 for both success and most
// failures, so a non-200 is the only signal there is.
