// What QRZ already told us it has no picture of.
//
// The photo is QRZ's alone — no other source carries one, and each lookup run
// seeds from the bare callsign — so a hook that skips the network whenever the
// name and location are already answered leaves the call-info panel with no
// photo for exactly the callsigns the operator knows best. Without something
// remembering an answer ACROSS runs, the only correct behaviour is to ask
// every time.
//
// This is that memory, and only the negative half of it: a call QRZ has no
// picture of is worth remembering, since nothing else about it will ever be
// worth a round-trip either. A call that HAS a photo is deliberately not
// cached — the URL is on the QSO and Call History carries it forward, and
// re-asking is what keeps a changed profile picture from being frozen.
//
// The store is the LOG, not a cache of its own: a past QSO with this station
// carries QRZ's own record of that lookup (`their.lookups`), and a record with
// no `image` in it IS the remembered answer. `host.kvSet` would have been the
// obvious home and is the wrong one — it is in-memory per extension namespace
// (the app's halo_extension_host.dart), so a cache built on it forgets everything the
// app is relaunched, which is exactly the span this needs to survive.
//
// A session-scoped map rides on top of that, so working the same station twice
// in one sitting does not re-read the log either.
//
// Pure, and its own module, so the rules below are testable without the host
// bridge index.ts pulls in.
