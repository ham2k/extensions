    // preference. A live callbook answer describes the station today; the

    // The cost of running last is that neither qrz nor ham2k-lookup can see
    // the log when they decide whether to skip their network round-trip, so
    // a station worked before is fetched afresh every time. That is the

    // of them carries a location (see there), so the merge's grid/city
    // reconciliation — which deletes the location fields a result did not
    // itself write — has nothing of ours to delete, and the order the two
