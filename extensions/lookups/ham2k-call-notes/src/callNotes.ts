// File format (same as app-polo's call-notes extension): one entry per line,

// key, everything after it is the note. Blank lines and `#`-prefixed lines
// are comments. The same key may appear on multiple lines; entries
// accumulate in file order. Note text may carry a leading emoji marker and
// basic Markdown (e.g. links).
