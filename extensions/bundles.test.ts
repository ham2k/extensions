// Every extension in this repository BUILDS, PACKS, and LOADS.
//
// Nothing else covers those three. A typecheck sees the source and never the
// bundle, so it cannot see an import the preset failed to rewrite, a manifest
// the packer would refuse, or a hook the manifest promises and nobody
// registers — and each of those is a bundle that installs and then does
// nothing, in someone else's app, with no error anywhere.
//
// The kernel here is a stub: enough of `globalThis.__polo` for the bundle to
// evaluate and hand over its registrations. It is not the host, so this proves
// the bundle LOADS rather than that it scores correctly — the rules are the
// engine's own tests' business.
