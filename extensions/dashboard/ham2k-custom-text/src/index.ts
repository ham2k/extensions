// A pane holding whatever the operator writes in it. The smallest useful
// extension panel there is, and the first written to exercise the panel
// system end to end (the app's docs/extensions/hooks.md, `panel`): a descriptor, a
// config form, host-persisted values, and markdown back out.
//
// It is also the first panel an operator would obviously want TWO of — a
// sked list beside a band plan — so it is the reference for `multiple`.
// Everything that makes several placements work is the host's: each gets
// its own id, and therefore its own config, with nothing to do here. The
// one obligation this side has is naming them, via the render result's
// `title`; without it every tab would read "Custom Text".
//
// The text is a TEMPLATE (the app's docs/extensions/templates.md), so the same pane
// can show the log's own numbers, and it is the reference for per-instance
// triggers for the same reason it is the reference for `multiple`: what one
// operator's text asks for is not what another's does, and a band plan that
// never changes must not be re-rendered on every keystroke because the pane
// beside it names the callsign being typed.
