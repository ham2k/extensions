// The QSY rule (11), as a message on the FYI line that says how much further
// to move:
//
//   "If any station solicits a call (eg, by sending "CQ," "QRZ?" "going up
//   5 kHz" or any other means of soliciting a response, including completion
//   of a contact where the frequency was inherited), that station is
//   permitted to work only one station in response to that solicitation.
//   The station must thereafter move at least 1 kHz before calling another
//   station, or at least 5 kHz before soliciting other calls. Once a station
//   is required to QSY, that station is not allowed to make another contact
//   on the vacated frequency until or unless at least one subsequent contact
//   is made on a new frequency."
//
// WHO SOLICITED is not in the log: HaLo's Run and S&P switch is the keyer's,
// and never reaches the contact or an extension. What the log does prove is
// two contacts in a row on one frequency — the second was solicited, by a CQ
// or by the frequency inherited from the first — and then the message says
// so. After a single contact it is hedged, "unless you answered a CQ": the
// operator knows which it was, and the distance is what they came to read.
//
// After each new contact the radio's dial is read once a second, and the
// message follows it as it turns: so far to call, so far to CQ, gone from
// 5 kHz out, and back if the dial returns to the vacated frequency before
// another contact. Without a radio to read there is no distance, so a proven
// duty gets the rule alone, for a minute.
