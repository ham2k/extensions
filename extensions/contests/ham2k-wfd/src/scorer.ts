// Winter Field Day scoring.
//
// DUPLICATED with `fd`, on purpose. The two contests are near-identical —
// same exchange, same points table, same dupe rule, same three-way section
// tally — and a factory would say so in one place. Each extension standing
// alone, readable and movable without reaching into a sibling, is worth more
// here than not repeating it.
//
// What actually differs from ARRL Field Day, and why a shared version would
// have had to be parameterised on all of it anyway:
//   - class is `1H`..`9O` — Home, Indoor, Mobile, Outdoor, no `PC` prefix
//   - the multiplier is the objectives met, each with its OWN weight
//   - there are no bonus points; the objectives ARE the bonus
//   - satellite contacts earn the multiplier but NOT QSO points
//
// The rules: https://www.winterfieldday.org/
