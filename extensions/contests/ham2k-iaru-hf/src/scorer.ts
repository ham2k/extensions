// IARU HF World Championship scoring, ported from app-polo's IARUHFExtension
// `scoringForQSO` / `accumulateScoreForOperation` / `summarizeScore` into a
// `ContestScorer`.
//
// The rules, per the IARU HF World Championship rules:
//   * Everyone sends an ITU zone, EXCEPT society headquarters stations (which
//     send their society abbreviation, e.g. ARRL, RSGB) and IARU officials
//     (which send AC, R1, R2 or R3). One exchange field therefore holds three
//     different kinds of value, and which one it is decides both the points and
//     the multiplier.
//   * Points: 1 within our own ITU zone, and 1 for any HQ or official station
//     however far away; 3 to a different zone on our own continent; 5 to
//     another continent.
//   * Multipliers are PER BAND: each zone, each HQ society and each IARU
//     office counts once per band. Total = points x multipliers.
//   * A station may be worked once per band per MODE — CW and phone are
//     separate contacts, unlike CQ WW. Digital modes don't count at all.
//   * Only 160/80/40/20/15/10m count.
//
// The one rule that reads oddly and is correct: an HQ station in our own zone
// is worth 1 like any other HQ station, because the HQ branch never consults
// zones. Polo does the same, and the rules describe HQ contacts as a flat 1.
