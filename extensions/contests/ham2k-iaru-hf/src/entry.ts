// restriction and station type the setup already asks for — and the Cabrillo
// `CATEGORY-` lines it becomes. The ARRL's log robot reads these to place the
// entry among the categories its results list; none of it changes the score.
// The same shape as `cqww`'s.
//
// The values are the ones the Cabrillo form the rules page links to
// (b4h.net/cabforms, IARU HF) offers: SINGLE-OP, MULTI-OP or CHECKLOG; ALL;
// MIXED, CW or SSB; HIGH, LOW or QRP; ONE, TWO or UNLIMITED; HQ; YOUTH.
//
// NOTHING is defaulted, as in the QSO parties: each answer is a claim about
// how we operated, so an unanswered question writes no line rather than a
// guessed one. What the rules make follow from an answer — a Multi-Single is
// high power and assisted, a Multi-Two low power and not — is written for it.
