// NRRL Nasjonal Field Day scoring, per the published rules
// (https://nrrl.no/tema/field-day/regler-for-nasjonal-fieldday/).
//
// A SIBLING of `r1-fd`, not a variant of it. The two run the same weekend and
// share an exchange, which invites reading this as the same contest with
// different numbers — it is not, and four of the differences are structural
// rather than parametric:
//   - all three modes run at once (CW / SSB / DIGIMODE), where an R1 running
//     is single-mode and rejects everything else
//   - a station may be worked once per band AND PER MODE, not once per band
//   - the multiplier carries band and mode as well as country (see MULTS)
//   - countries are DXCC, where R1 scores the WAE list
// Plus 60m counts here, the point table is 1/2/3/4 rather than 2/3/4/6, and
// bonuses run to five figures.
//
// There is no fixed-to-fixed rule to mirror because the case cannot arise:
// every entrant is portable by definition (all stations sign /P, and
// "nettspenning fra det offentlige el-nett må ikke brukes").

// TYPE-only from the SDK, and nothing else — a value import (`tally`, or the
// translator behind `i18n.ts`) makes this module unresolvable to plain
// `node --test`, which is why `fd`'s scorer has no unit tests of its own. The
// rules encoded here are worth testing more than the summary is worth
// translating, so the breakdown below stays in language-neutral numbers, as
// `cqwpx` and `r1-fd` do.
