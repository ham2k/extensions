// COMPUTED, not published in a data file: NRRL states the date as a RULE — the
// first complete weekend in September, "lørdag ... kl. 1300 UTC til søndag ...
// kl. 1300 UTC" — so it is right for every year, including ones nobody has
// updated a file for. Same approach as `fd`, `wfd` and `r1-fd`.
//
// Deliberately its own copy rather than an import from `r1-fd`, even though
// that extension computes the SAME window for its SSB running — same weekend,
// same 1300 UTC opening, same 24 hours. Each contest extension stands alone
// and movable, which is the rule `fd` and `wfd` set for exactly this
// situation; sharing a schedule between two contests couples them for as long
// as their rulebooks happen to agree.
