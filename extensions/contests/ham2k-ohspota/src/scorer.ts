// Ohio State Parks On The Air scoring, from the sponsor's rules (event.ts names
// the document).
//
//   "QSO POINTS - Each complete non-duplicate on each mode and/or band contact
//   is worth one point."
//   "MULTIPLIERS - Multipliers are the 76 Ohio State Parks (1 per park = 76
//   maximum) the State Park YOU are operating from will count as a multiplier."
//   "FINAL SCORE - Multiply QSO points by the total number of multipliers."
//   Their example: 37 contacts from PUN, 9 other parks contacted — "9 plus PUN,
//   Total score = 10 x 37 = 370 points."
//
// What follows from the rest of the rules:
//
//   * SSB and CW only. A digital contact is not a contact in this contest, so it
//     is refused rather than given a point.
//   * "Stations may be worked once on each band/mode." A park they had not given
//     us on that band and mode reopens it, which is how a multi-park operator is
//     worked again from their next park.
//   * OUR park is a multiplier outright — no count of contacts to reach first —
//     and ONCE: another station worked in the park we are in does not make it
//     two ("1 per park = 76 maximum").
//   * WHO MAY WORK WHOM: "Non-Ohio stations may work only Ohio stations located
//     in an Ohio State Park; Ohio stations not located in an Ohio State Park may
//     only contact stations operating from inside an Ohio State Park." So in no
//     park ourselves, a contact with a station in no park is worth nothing. In a
//     park, everyone counts.
//   * EACH PARK WE OPERATE FROM IS ITS OWN ENTRY: "If you activate three Ohio
//     State Parks in the MPO category, send in three Summary Sheets and three Log
//     files." Contacts, duplicates and multipliers all start over at the next
//     park, and the summary states a claimed score for each — the figure a
//     summary sheet asks for.
//
// The entry's own conditions — ten contacts, four of them with other parks —
// are stated in the summary and change no QSO's worth. The contest period is not
// enforced, as in the other contests here.
