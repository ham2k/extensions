// Whose reference this is, and which park each side of a QSO is in, resolved
// ONCE for everyone who asks.
//
// The scorer, the ADIF fields, the Cabrillo writer and the operation title all
// need the same two answers, and they must agree: a QSO scored as one park and
// submitted as another shows a multiplier the log does not support.
//
// Everything here is in the sponsor's three-letter identifiers, because that is
// what stations exchange. The TYPED value wins: what the operator keyed is what
// was sent on the air, so it is the data of record. A POTA reference is the
// fallback — it is where an identifier comes from when nothing was keyed.
