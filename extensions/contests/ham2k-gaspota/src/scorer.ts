// Georgia State Parks on the Air scoring, from the "2026 GA-POTA Rules v.1.2".
// The sponsor scores TWO entries by two formulas, and this computes both.
//
//   ACTIVATORS (§6.1.1): "Base Score = (number of parks activated) x (sum of the
//   scores from each park), with the score from each park being 1 point for each
//   QSO, plus an additional 5 pts for each QSO with each distinct GA park." The
//   sponsor's score sheet states it as one line — Contact Points = B + (5*C),
//   Base Score = D * A — with C counted once across the whole entry ("each of
//   the 52 parks counts only once"). §6.1.2.2: 2 × (80 + 135) = 430.
//
//   HUNTERS (§6.2.1): "Base Score = (number of Georgia state parks hunted) x
//   (total number of contacts with Georgia state parks)", plus 100 for hunting
//   on both UTC days. §6.2.2: 28 parks × 45 contacts = 1260. There is NO
//   5-point term, and a contact with anyone else is not a contact at all: the
//   sponsor derives this score from the activators' logs.
//
// Both formulas reproduce every row of the sponsor's published 2026 results —
// 65 activators, 3,431 hunters — and those results settle two things the text
// leaves open:
//
//   * A PARK COUNTS AS ACTIVATED WITH FEWER THAN TEN QSOS. "(10 or more
//     contacts)" appears only in the Multi-Park class definition (§5.1.1.1), and
//     an entry with 9 QSOs was scored with one park. So `P` is the listed parks
//     we made a contact from, with no threshold.
//   * One entrant may be on BOTH tables, so an operation that does both shows
//     the activator score and states the hunter one beneath it.
//
// WHAT A CONTACT IS. §4.2: "Each band/mode/operator counts as a separate
// contact", §4.4 makes the mode an exact one, and:
//
//   * each of OUR parks is its own log (the filename names one park, §7.2.1), so
//     a station worked from one park is a new contact from the next;
//   * "n-fer contacts must be listed separately with <SIG_INFO> for each park to
//     count as a new contact" (the sponsor's rules page), so a station at
//     several parks is a contact per park — every POTA park, since "there is no
//     'bonus' for contacting out of state parks, so they count just as regular
//     contacts" (FAQ).
//
// A HUNTER's contact is a row in an activator's log, where our own park does not
// figure: it is kept by station, band, mode and THEIR listed park alone.
//
// The three activator bonuses (repeat offender, first-time activator, hike-in)
// and the hunters' repeat bonus rest on facts no log holds; the sponsor credits
// them from its own lists and upload form. The contest period is not enforced,
// as in the other contests here.
