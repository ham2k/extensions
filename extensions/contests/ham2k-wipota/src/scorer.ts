// Wisconsin Parks on the Air scoring, from the sponsor's rules
// (https://wipota.com/files/WIPOTA_contest_rules.pdf, dated January 27, 2026).
//
//   Score = # of QSOs × # of unique WI parks.
//
//   * Every QSO is worth one, whoever it is with — "hams in other WI parks, as
//     well as hams not located in a park in any state, province or country".
//   * A station may be worked "multiple times on a given band. Once per mode",
//     and the rules count MODES, not mode families: their own example works one
//     station on SSB, AM, FM, C4FM, CW, FT8 and FT4 and calls it seven QSOs. So
//     the duplicate slot is call + band + mode, where every other contest here
//     folds modes into PHONE/CW/DATA.
//   * "All amateur bands, except 60, 30, 17 and 12 meters."
//   * A multiplier is each unique WI park worked, plus "any other UNIQUE parks
//     which you have operated in during the WIPOTA contest and have had at least
//     ten (10) QSOs in that park". Out-of-state parks earn nothing.
//
// ONE READING THE RULES DO NOT SETTLE: a station already worked on a band and
// mode counts AGAIN from a WI park it had not given us there — a rover is a new
// contact at each park, which is what ham2k-stateparks does for the other park
// events. The sponsor's text says neither yes nor no. Our own move to a new park
// does NOT reopen a slot; the rules give nothing to read that from, and an
// undercount is the safer error in a number the operator types into the
// sponsor's form.
//
// The contest period (1600–2300 UTC) is not enforced, as in every other scorer
// here: the operation is what the operator says is their entry.
//
// The parks come from POTA refs this extension does not own — see parks.ts.
