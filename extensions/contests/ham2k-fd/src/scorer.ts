// ARRL Field Day scoring.
//
// DUPLICATED with `wfd`, on purpose. The two contests are near-identical —
// same exchange, same points table, same dupe rule, same three-way section
// tally — and a factory would say so in one place. Each extension standing
// alone, readable and movable without reaching into a sibling, is worth more
// here than not repeating it.
//
// What actually differs from Winter Field Day, and why a shared version would
// have had to be parameterised on all of it anyway:
//   - class is `1A`..`14F`, optionally `PC`-prefixed ("please copy")
//   - the WARC bands score nothing
//   - the multiplier comes from transmitter power and power source
//   - there are bonus points, from a checklist in setup
//
// The rules: https://field-day.arrl.org/
