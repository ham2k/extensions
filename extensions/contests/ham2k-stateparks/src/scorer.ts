// State-park event scoring, ported from app-polo's StateParksExtension
// `scoringForQSO` / `accumulateScoreForOperation` / `summarizeScore` into a
// `ContestScorer`.
//
// What these events are, and why this scorer is unlike the six before it: the
// contest is played THROUGH POTA. Points come from the parks — the ones we are
// activating (`potaActivation` refs on the operation) and the ones the station
// we worked is in (`pota` refs on the QSO) — so this is the first scorer that
// reads refs it does not own. It can: the harness hands `scoreQso` the
// segment-effective operation (sdk/src/scoring.ts), so a park added mid-log
// through a segment is seen for exactly the QSOs it covers.
//
// The rules, per event, are data (events.ts). The shape is common to all four:
//   * Points per QSO by super-mode, ×1 per park we are activating, ×1 per NEW
//     park the station is in (a park-to-park pair counts each park).
//   * A station may be worked once per band and mode, and again from a park
//     they hadn't given us on that band and mode.
//   * Multipliers are parks: activated, or activated + hunted, or none.
//   * Bonuses: a listed bonus station, once; and points per park we activate.
//
// DIVERGENCES from polo, per the RFC's fix-on-port decision (§8). Every one of
// these is a live defect there, not a rules disagreement:
//
//   1. `scoring.bonusStations.push(...)` throws — the object is initialised
//      with `bonuses: []` and no `bonusStations` — so working Texas's K5LRK
//      crashes the scorer (StateParksExtension.js:243-281). Bonus stations are
//      credited here, once each.
//   2. The per-park-activated bonus is never awarded. polo guards it on
//      `sp.options.bonusPoints.perParkActivated` while every data file puts
//      `bonusPoints` at the top level, so Texas's and Florida's 100 points per
//      park are dead (`:373-379`).
//   3. `bonusPoints` never reaches the total anyway: polo adds `score.bonus`,
//      a key nothing ever writes (`:389-390`).
//   4. Parks we activate are never counted. polo maps its activation refs to
//      strings and then filters them as if they were still objects
//      (`:228-229`), so `activatedParks` is always empty — which silently
//      turns Georgia's activated-park multiplier into 1 and halves the
//      activated+hunted rule for Texas and Ohio.
//   5. Every POTA activation multiplied a QSO's points, whether or not the park
//      was in the event (`:241`). Only the event's own parks do here.
//   6. Band limits: polo excludes the WARC bands for all four events and never
//      reads the per-event `bands`/`excludedBands` its data files carry, so
//      Ohio's 80-10m rule and Florida's 160-6m rule do nothing there. Honoured
//      here (see events.ts).
//   7. Georgia's 5 points per distinct park (`points.distinctStatePark`) are
//      read by nothing in polo — its own notes call this out as missing.
//      Awarded here to the first contact with each park. This one is a GUESS,
//      not a fix: polo's code cannot settle it and the data only names the
//      number, so "5 points for a park you hadn't worked yet" is a reading of
//      the sponsor's rules that wants a human to confirm it. Every other item
//      here has polo's own data or notes behind it.
//   8. polo's "(N dupes)" counts every zero-scoring QSO, invalid bands
//      included (`:344-347`). Only duplicates are counted here.
//
// Defect 4 has a second half worth stating, because the line range above hides
// it: the SAME string/object mistake is made for the parks it hunts
// (`:231-232`), so for the three events that have no exchange polo credits no
// park on either side — no hunted-park multiplier, and a park-list summary that
// never fills in.
//
// One thing polo does that this CANNOT do, rather than chooses not to: it turns
// a park abbreviation into a `pota` ref on the QSO (`:493-504`), which is how
// its park credit reaches POTA. Cross-extension ref writing is structurally
// refused in HaLo — the app's `qso_patch.dart` drops any patch ref an extension doesn't
// own — so an abbreviation is read straight off our own ref here instead. It is
// the same park either way; what the operator loses is the POTA hunter chip
// filling itself in, which is M9's `georgia-pota` work.
//
//   9. `powerMultipliers` is read by nothing in polo, so a Texas QRP entrant
//      there is scored short of a term the rules give them. Read here, from the
//      power class the setup form now asks for — as a SUMMAND, which is what
//      §6.5.1 makes it despite the name: "total QSO points X (power multiplier +
//      ... worked multiplier + ... activated multiplier) + bonus points".
//
// Not ported, because no shipped event's data uses them: the
// `bonusStationPerMode` / `bonusStationPerBandMode` options.
