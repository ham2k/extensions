// The four state-park events, and one normalized view of them.
//
// `events/*.json` are app-polo's files VERBATIM (`src/extensions/contests/
// stateparks/states/`), so the yearly re-sync — dates move, park lists grow —
// stays a file copy and a legible diff against polo. Everything that reads
// them goes through `eventFor`, which is where the two data-shape quirks polo
// grew are absorbed:
//
//   * Some keys sit under `options`, others at the top level, for no reason
//     beyond the order they were added. `options.multipliers` and
//     `bonusPoints.perParkActivated` are siblings in intent and cousins in the
//     file.
//   * `parks` is a ref → 1 set for three events and a ref → abbreviation map
//     for Ohio, which also repeats the same pairs in `parkReferences`.
//
// Keys polo's code reads and this does not: `questions`, `internalNotes`,
// `disabled`, `secondStart`/`secondEnd` (no shipped event has a split period).
// `powerMultipliers` is read by nothing in polo either, and IS read here now
// that the setup form asks for a power class — see `powerMultipliers` below for
// what Texas's rules actually do with it.
//
// Two things the files DON'T carry, and so live here as tables against the
// event key: which format each sponsor accepts, and the classes each publishes.
// polo has no notion of either, so putting them in the files would fork them
// from the copies this re-syncs against every year.
//
// Keys polo's code IGNORES and this honours — the band lists. polo applies one
// hard-coded WARC exclusion to every event and never consults the per-event
// `bands`/`excludedBands` the data files carry, so Ohio's 80-10m limit and
// Florida's 160-6m list do nothing there. Both are live here; that is the
// fix-on-port §8 asks for, and it is a real behaviour change: an OHSP contact
// on 160m now scores zero, correctly.
