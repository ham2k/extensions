// State park on-the-air events. Ported from app-polo's StateParksExtension.
//
// The seventh contest ported (docs/design/contests.md M5), and the first that is
// FOUR contests: one extension, one event per operation, chosen either from the
// activity search (§5.6's `suggest`, so "ohio" finds it by name) or from the
// setup form's event list. The event key lives in the ref's own `ref` field —
// `{type: 'stateparks', ref: 'OHSP'}` — which is what selects its rules, its
// park list and its exports.
//
// It is also the first contest played THROUGH another activity: points come from
// POTA parks, ours and theirs. See scorer.ts for what that means for scoring,
// and for the divergences from polo it forced.
//
// Two shapes of event, from one code path:
//   * Texas, Florida and Georgia have NO exchange. The parks come from the POTA
//     refs the operator is already logging, so there is no entry-row field at
//     all and nothing to type.
//   * Ohio exchanges a three-letter park abbreviation, which is this milestone's
//     `kind: 'options'` field — 76 codes, searched, Space to accept.
