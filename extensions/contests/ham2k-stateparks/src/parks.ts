// Which parks a QSO is worth, resolved ONCE for everyone who asks.
//
// The scorer, the ADIF fields, the Cabrillo writer and the operation title all
// need the same two answers — which park we are working from, and which park the
// station we worked is in — and they must agree. They didn't: the scorer read
// the QSO's POTA reference first and the exports read the typed abbreviation
// first, so a QSO carrying both, disagreeing, scored as one park and was
// submitted as another. The app would show a multiplier the submitted log does
// not support. polo has the same split (`scoringForQSO` vs
// `qsoToCabrilloParts`); this is a fix, not a port.
//
// The typed value wins. What the operator keyed is what was sent on the air, so
// it is the data of record — the same reading §5.8 takes of a serial number,
// where the number DISPLAYED is written to the QSO because that is what went
// out. A POTA reference is the fallback, and for the three events with no
// exchange at all it is the only source.
