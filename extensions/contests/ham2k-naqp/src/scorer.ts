// North American QSO Party scoring, ported from app-polo's NAQPExtension
// `scoringForQSO` / `accumulateScoreForOperation` / `summarizeScore` into a
// `ContestScorer`.
//
// The rules, per the NCJ NAQP rules:
//   * Every valid QSO is worth 1 point. There is no distance or continent
//     ladder — the scoring is entirely in the multipliers.
//   * Multipliers are states, provinces and North American DXCC entities,
//     counted ONCE PER BAND. `DX` is a perfectly good exchange and a perfectly
//     good QSO, but it is not a multiplier.
//   * A station may be worked once per band.
//   * Only 160/80/40/20/15/10m count.
//   * NAQP CW, SSB and RTTY are separate contests on separate weekends, so the
//     operation names one mode and QSOs in another don't count.
//
// Divergences from polo, per the RFC's fix-on-port decision (§8):
//   * polo validates NEITHER band nor mode — it defines VALID_BANDS and never
//     consults it, so a 30m QSO scores and a CW contact counts in the SSB
//     contest. Both are checked here.
//   * polo's duplicate test mixes exact mode (`q.mode === mode`) with
//     super-mode (`superModeForMode(q.mode) === superMode`) in the same
//     function, so USB and LSB on one band read as two different contacts.
//     Since the contest is single-mode anyway, a duplicate here is simply the
//     same station on the same band.
