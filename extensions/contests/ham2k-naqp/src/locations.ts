// INLINE, not a shared dataset. docs/design/contests.md §5.3's own table places
// "NAQP locations (111)" here rather than in `operation-data`, and §5.3's M4
// amendment says why that is the right call generally: `ContestScorer` is
// synchronous, so a scorer could never await a cross-extension lookup anyway.
// The whole set is 110 unique codes and well under a kilobyte, read in exactly
// two places, both inside this bundle.
