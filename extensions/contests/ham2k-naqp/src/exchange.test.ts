// Guessing NAQP's exchange. A guess here is not a hint — it is STAMPED onto the
// ref at save and exported as though the station had sent it — so a wrong guess
// is a wrong claim in a submitted log, not a cosmetic annoyance.
//
// Both bugs found in this file's logic were data-shape assumptions that one
// command against the country file would have disproved. These check the
// country file rather than restating what it was assumed to say.
