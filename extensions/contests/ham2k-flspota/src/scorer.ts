// Florida State Parks on the Air scoring, from the "2026 FSPOTA Rules v.1.3".
//
//   Activators (§6.1): Base Score = "sum of the scores from each park, with the
//   score from each park being 1 point for each SSB or Digital QSO and 2 points
//   for each CW QSO". "There are no multipliers". Plus 100 points per park
//   activated, a park being activated at 10 QSOs.
//
//   Hunters (§6.2) have no formula: "the number of QSOs made, and the number of
//   Florida parks contacted will be tabulated from all of the activator logs".
//
// WHAT A CONTACT IS. §4.3: "Each band/mode/operator counts as a separate
// contact", and §4.5 makes the mode an exact one. Two things follow from the way
// the sponsor takes logs rather than from a sentence of their own:
//
//   * EACH OF OUR PARKS IS ITS OWN LOG. §7.2: "One separate log is required for
//     each park activated", and the base score is summed park by park. A station
//     worked from one park is a new contact from the next, so the slot a contact
//     occupies carries our park. An activation at two listed parks at once is a
//     contact in both logs, and scores in both.
//   * A STATION AT SEVERAL PARKS IS SEVERAL CONTACTS. §7.4 asks for "the
//     recommended POTA log format", which writes one record per park hunted, and
//     those records are what the sponsor counts. So an activator's contact is
//     worth one per park of theirs — every POTA park, not only Florida's, since
//     the record is written either way. A park they had not given us in a slot
//     reopens it, which is also how a rover is worked again.
//
// A hunter's contact is one the sponsor finds in an ACTIVATOR's log, so for an
// operation in no listed park only contacts with listed parks count.
//
// The contest period and its 8 am – 8 pm operating hours (§2) are not enforced,
// as in the other contests here: the operation is what the operator says is
// their entry.
