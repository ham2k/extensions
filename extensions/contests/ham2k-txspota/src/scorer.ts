// Texas State Parks On The Air scoring, from the sponsor's rules as they stood
// for the 2026 event (event.ts names the document).
//
//   §6.5.1, activators: "Total score = total QSO points X (power multiplier +
//   Texas State Parks worked multiplier + Texas State Parks activated
//   multiplier) + bonus points."
//   §6.5.2, hunters: the same without the activated term.
//
// The three multipliers ADD. §6.3.3's "activation of two parks doubles the …
// score" cannot hold beside that formula, and the formula is the explicit one.
// Points are 1 per phone or digital contact and 2 per CW contact (§6.2).
//
// The bonuses a log can support (§6.4): 5 for the host station K5LRK, once; 50
// for activating more than three parks; 50 for working the same activator call
// in three different parks. The fourth, for a photo of the park sign, is claimed
// on the sponsor's upload form. There is NO bonus per park activated: a park is
// worth its term in the multiplier sum and nothing more.
//
// WHAT A CONTACT IS. §6.1: "Stations may be worked once per band per mode per
// park", and §4.2 makes the mode an exact one. "Per park" is read both ways,
// because both are how the sponsor takes the log:
//
//   * per park of OURS — the file names the park it is for, or carries it on
//     every record (§8.4.1.1), so a station worked from one park is a new
//     contact from the next;
//   * per park of THEIRS — which is how a rover is worked again, the very thing
//     §6.4.3 rewards. A station at several parks is a contact per park, as the
//     POTA-format log the sponsor asks for writes a record for each.
//
// HUNTERS: §5.2, "QSO with stations other than Texas State Park Activators do
// not count toward their Total Score." No such sentence binds an activator, so
// in a listed park every contact counts.
//
// The contest period is not enforced, as in the other contests here.
