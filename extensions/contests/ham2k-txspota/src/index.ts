// Texas State Parks On The Air — the Lake Area Amateur Radio Klub's April event
// (https://www.tspota.org).
//
// One extension, one event: the ref's TYPE is the whole of its identity and it
// carries no `ref` field. Operations logged under the combined State Parks
// extension carry `{type: 'stateparks', ref: 'TXSP'}` instead, and are answered
// for as they stand (event.ts, `LEGACY_CLAIM`).
//
// It is played THROUGH POTA: there is no exchange field at all, and the parks
// are the POTA refs the operator is already logging (parks.ts). The rules are
// in scorer.ts.
//
// What the sponsor takes is an ADIF whose FILENAME names the park (§8.4.1.1), so
// that file is ours to write rather than POTA's — one per park, since the name
// carries exactly one. Setup asks for the power class, which is a term in the
// score; the operating classes and the photo bonus are claimed on the sponsor's
// upload form and change nothing this produces.
