// Satellite operations — the only activity
// that is not an award. Nothing is activated and nothing is scored: a satellite
// QSO is an ordinary contact that happens to name the bird it went through, so
// this registers no `scoring` and no `export`, exactly as app-polo does.
//
// The reference is a TRANSPONDER, not a satellite: `SO-50/145.85/fm` is name,
// uplink MHz and uplink mode joined by `/`, which is app-polo's own format —
// logs move between the two apps unchanged. It has to be the transponder rather
// than the bird because AO-7's two transponders answer on different bands (2m
// up → 10m down, 70cm up → 2m down), so the choice decides both what the radio
// is tuned to and what `BAND_RX` says.
//
// Two ways in, per the decision in docs/design/activities.md §3.5:
//   - a PICKER (`kind: 'options'` per QSO, `kind: 'form'` per operation), which
//     records the bird but cannot tune the radio — a control writes its value
//     and cannot ask for anything else to happen;
//   - a COMMAND (`SAT SO-50`), which can, because commands emit `setVfo`.
// Neither needed a core change. Letting controls emit command actions is the
// reusable fix and is written up as the alternative in §3.5.
