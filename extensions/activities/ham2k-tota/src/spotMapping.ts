// path alias (see extensions/tsconfig.json) that Node's own module resolver,
// used by `node --test`, can't resolve at runtime — so this file may import
// types from it, which type stripping erases, but never values.

/// A QRT claims its operator's slot without taking it: a station that has said
/// it is done must not come back to the board from an earlier spot. That only
/// holds if the newest spot is the one considered, which is why the order is
/// established here rather than assumed of the feed — nothing in the payload
/// promises one, and a feed handed over oldest-first would silently invert the
/// rule, leaving a packed-up station calling. The feed stamps to the second,
/// so a QRT posted in the same second as the spot it retracts needs the
/// tiebreaker too — without it that pair falls back to the feed order this
/// sort exists to stop depending on.
///
/// Nothing is aged out here. app-polo cuts the feed at an hour, but HaLo's own
/// `SpotsService.maxSpotAge` and the panel's age filter already govern every
/// source together — a cutoff of our own would retire a TOTA spot while a POTA
/// one posted at the same moment stayed, and leave TOTA contributing nothing
/// to the age filter's own longest bucket.
///
/// A spot whose `time_utc` will not parse is dropped: an unranked entry would
/// beat the QRT that followed it, and `spotsForCall` reads an absent time as
/// the epoch and would drop it from call lookup anyway, leaving it half on the
/// board. Counted rather than passed over, so a wire format that moves under
/// us empties the board loudly.
