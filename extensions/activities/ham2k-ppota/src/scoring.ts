// PPOTA activates on five QSOs with five DIFFERENT callsigns in a UTC day
// (rules §2.3, §2.4), which `activityScorer` has no rule for. Its activation
// credit is per contact, and two cases put more than one callsign's worth on
// one station:
//
// - one contact naming an activator on two references credits once per
//   reference (`huntedRefs.length || 1`);
// - a station worked at a reference and later the same day with none is, to
//   its duplicate check, a different contact, so it credits twice.
//
// So the scorer runs as it is, and this caps what it credited: the first
// contact with a callsign on a UTC day is worth at most one toward the
// activation, and every later one nothing. Hunting credit, a P2P contact with
// a new reference, is left exactly as the scorer gave it.
//
// The same wrapper HOTA carries, for the same rule; extensions share no code
// but the SDK's.
