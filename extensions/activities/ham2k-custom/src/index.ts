// Custom Activity — the escape hatch for a program HaLo has no extension for.
// A regional castles award, a club's one-off event, a scheme that exists only
// on a forum post: you name it yourself and the log carries it as SIG/MY_SIG
// like any other.
//
// It is the only activity with nothing to search. Every other one resolves a
// typed reference against a downloaded list; here the operator IS the list, so
// there is no `suggest`, no `dataFile`, and no lookup — and consequently no
// validation beyond "not empty". A reference nobody publishes cannot be wrong.
//
// It also does no scoring, matching app-polo: an activation threshold belongs
// to a program, and this one has none. Contacts are recorded and exported, not
// counted.
//
// ONE activation reference, where app-polo allows several. See
// docs/design/activities.md §3.6 — the multi-reference form control that would
// take is core work, and nothing in the ADIF output depends on it: MY_SIG_INFO
// carries one reference in either app. Hunting is unaffected — a QSO still
// records as many custom references as the other station gives.
