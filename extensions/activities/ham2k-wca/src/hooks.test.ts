// WCA through its HOOKS. Two things set it apart from the other castle and
// lighthouse awards, and both are traps:
//
// - It ANSWERS for the English and Belgian castle types too, because their
//   references are WCA references. Whatever it answers for them — a name, a
//   title, a link — must hold for them as well as for its own type, and must
//   not claim them as WCA's.
// - Its reference pattern is the loosest of the family, so it accepts BCA's and
//   ECA's references as its own. On import the SIG is the only thing telling
//   them apart, and a hook that reads the pair without checking it invents a
//   WCA activation on every Belgian castle log.
