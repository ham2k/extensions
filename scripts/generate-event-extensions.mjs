// Writes one extension per QSO party, from that party's own module —
// `packages/qso-parties/src/parties/<code>.ts` in,
// `extensions/contests/ham2k-<abbr>/` out.
//
// Usage:
//   node scripts/generate-event-extensions.mjs             write the missing ones
//   node scripts/generate-event-extensions.mjs --force     rewrite every one
//   node scripts/generate-event-extensions.mjs --manifests rewrite only the
//       manifests of the extensions that already exist. The yearly re-sync:
//       `relevance.dates` moves with every sponsor's calendar, and nothing
//       else in an extension does — so this is the run that does not touch a
//       line of anyone's hand-written prose.
//
// Fifty events differ from each other only in identity and in which party they
// import, so every field that is not boilerplate is DERIVED here rather than
// typed fifty times: the key from the party's short name, the description and
// the keywords from its state list, the icon and the `relevance` ranking from
// its entity, and `hooks` from the refType the party states and the five
// registrations the template makes. A sponsor's re-sync therefore reaches the
// extensions by re-running this, and an extension edited by hand is one the
// next run silently reverts — which is why an existing directory is skipped
// unless `--force` says otherwise.
//
// The four events that predate this script (7QP, CPQP, NYQP, TXQP) are
// hand-written and carry per-party prose in `src/index.ts`; `--force` replaces
// that prose with this template's. Nothing else about them changes.
